# React Best Practices

When writing or reviewing React code, follow these guidelines:

## Component Structure
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused (single responsibility)
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks

## State Management
- Use `useState` for simple local state
- Use `useReducer` for complex state logic
- Avoid prop drilling - use Context API when needed
- Consider state management libraries (Zustand, Redux) for global state

## Performance Optimization
- Memoize expensive calculations with `useMemo`
- Memoize callbacks with `useCallback`
- Use `React.memo` for component memoization
- Avoid inline object/array creation in JSX

## Effect Management
- Keep `useEffect` focused on single concerns
- Always clean up side effects (return cleanup function)
- List all dependencies in dependency array
- Consider using `useLayoutEffect` for DOM measurements

## Props Best Practices
- Destructure props at component level
- Use TypeScript for prop types when possible
- Provide default values for optional props
- Avoid spreading all props indiscriminately

## JSX Guidelines
- Keep JSX readable and maintainable
- Extract complex conditional rendering into separate components
- Use fragments (`<>...</>`) to avoid extra DOM nodes
- Prefer semantic HTML elements

## Error Handling
- Use Error Boundaries for component errors
- Handle async errors appropriately
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Consider loading and error states in data fetching
```
